A collection of medical item animations, models and textures for FDDA. Sister mod to FDDA Enhanced Animations - Food and drinks.
As many items as possible were converted to fancier gunslinger animations.
Some items had their use sounds replaced/enhanced.

There werent many gunslinger medical animations, but this has injector, bandage and exo anims.

Originally made/adapted for ‚Å†BHS realistic overhaul by me, but separated out into a separate mod. Fully DLTX.

Goes hand in hand with BHS Realistic Overhaul. This mod was originally a part of it.

List:
Medkits are untouched.
Bandage replaced.
All the injector animations use the gunslinger injector one.
Exo animations added.
That is it. There really arent that many of them.

REQUIRES FDDA(this is an extension to it).
Like the original mod, Possibly requires THAP
