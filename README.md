A collection of medical item animations, models and textures for FDDA. Sister mod to FDDA Enhanced Animations - Food and drinks.
As many items as possible were converted to fancier gunslinger animations.
Some items had their use sounds replaced/enhanced.

There werent many gunslinger medical animations, but this has injector, bandage and exo anims.

Originally made/adapted for ‚Å†BHS realistic overhaul by me, but separated out into a separate mod. Fully DLTX.

Goes hand in hand with BHS Realistic Overhaul. This mod was originally a part of it.

List:
Medkits are untouched.
Bandage replaced.
All the injector animations use the gunslinger injector one.
Exo animations added.
That is it. There really arent that many of them.
